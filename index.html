  <div class="Question">
    What do you think is the importance of knowing Tags and Attributes?
    <br>
    <p class="answer">Knowing tags and attributes is essential because they tell the browser/webiste about what part of your webpage
      is and how it should behave. Knowing these will help your webpage content properly like headings, body, the images, links, and etc. 
      Mastering the essentials of building a webpage will make your work easier, and fix bugs effectively.

  <div class="Question">
    What do you think would be the best HTML editor to use for beginners? Share your thoughts about this editor (e.g., cite some features and explain briefly what you like about it)
    <br>
    <p class="answer"><strong>Visual Studio Code(VS)</strong> is one of the most HTML editor for me since this app helps me a lot. It is 
      easy to use but it is also powerful when you have advance knowledge using this app. What I like the most in VS code is the 
      desing, the extensions and it is easy to link it in github that helps me to learn faster in building a website.
